# partition-manager

This lambda function runs athena add partition on a schedule (once per hour) to update partitions in Athena.

### Assumptions

It's assumed the format for partitions is:

```
"year={year}, month={month}, day={day}, hour={hour}"
```

Change this in the script if your partitions are different.

Why not use crawlers?
* Crawlers can become expensive and time-consuming to execute as they have to scan each file
* If data from upstream sources changes enough that the crawler created new tables (even with grouping set), the crawler will start spitting out potentially hundreds of tables.  This threshold is based on comparisons with existing/older data and can be very difficult to debug.  While this can be mitigated with crawler config, in production it's not something we want to deal with when alternative/cheaper methods exist for updating partitions on non-changing schema

Why not use MSCK?
* MSCK can time out and there isn't a clean way to make sure it completes every run
* MSCK incurs s3 get charges and because it has to scan partitions this cost can start to balloon

## Deploy the sample application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* AWS CLI - [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [configure it with your AWS credentials].
* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

The SAM CLI uses an Amazon S3 bucket to store your application's deployment artifacts. If you don't have a bucket suitable for this purpose, create one. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` in the commands in this section with a unique bucket name.

```bash
partition-manager$ aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

To prepare the application for deployment, use the `sam package` command.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket BUCKET_NAME
```

The SAM CLI creates deployment packages, uploads them to the S3 bucket, and creates a new version of the template that refers to the artifacts in the bucket. 

To deploy the application, use the `sam deploy` command.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name partition-manager \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
partition-manager$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name partition-manager \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`HelloWorldApi`]' \
    --output table
``` 

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build` command.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam build
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `hello_world/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam local start-api
partition-manager$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```

The SAM CLI reads the application template to determine the API's routes and the functions that they invoke. The `Events` property on each function's definition includes the route and method for each path.

```yaml
      Events:
        HelloWorld:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Add a resource to your application
The application template uses AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to define application resources. AWS SAM is an extension of AWS CloudFormation with a simpler syntax for configuring common serverless application resources such as functions, triggers, and APIs. For resources not included in [the SAM specification](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md), you can use standard [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) resource types.

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
partition-manager$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name partition-manager --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Unit tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and run unit tests.

```bash
partition-manager$ pip install pytest pytest-mock --user
partition-manager$ python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application and the bucket that you created, use the AWS CLI.

```bash
partition-manager$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name partition-manager
partition-manager$ aws s3 rb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```
